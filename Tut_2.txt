Port Mapping and Environment Variables

If we run a node js or any server inside our container we need to provide a port number where it can run
So we can map the port of the container to the host machine using the -p option

docker run -it -p 8000:8000 piyushgargdev/mynodeapp
-it ==> interactive mode
-p ==> port mapping
8000:8000 ==> port of the host machine : container
piyushgargdev/mynodeapp ==> image that is being run in the container


docker run -it -p 6000:8000 piyushgargdev/mynodeapp
This will map the port 6000 of the host machine to the port 8000 of the container
Now it will run on localhost:6000 in browser
