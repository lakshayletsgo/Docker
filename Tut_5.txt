Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
With just one command we can execute the docker and dont need to write the entire the environment and expose ports again and again

To do this we just need to make a file called docker-compose.yml
After this we just write the configuration


Then we just run the command 
docker compose up 
To start a new stack of containers in a docker 
This container will have redis and postgres as two images


docker compose down
This will delete the stack


docker compose up -d
This will run the stack in detached mode. That means it will run in background
