Introduction to some basic commands
Replace ==> container_name with actually container name

docker run -it ubuntu
This command starts a container having a image of ubuntu. The -it flag is used to attach the terminal to the container. The -it flag is called interactive mode.
It is used to tell that open terminal in the container
This will create a new container everytime we run this command
It will first check if we have the ubuntu image locally in the docker if we dont have it, it will pull it from hub.docker.com 
hub.docker.com is like github for docker images. It is a central location where all the docker images are stored.


docker container ls
This command will list all running docker containers. It will show us the id of the container, the name of the container and the image they are using
If we want to see all the containers including the ones that are not running, we can use this command


docker container ls -a
This command will list all the container whether they are running or not.


docker start container_name
This will start the container we named it 


docker stop container_name
This will stop the container


docker exec container_name ls
This command will execute the ls command inside the container. It will list all the files and directories in container_name container


docker start container_name
docker exec -it container_name bash
This command will open a new terminal inside the container. We can use this command to execute any command inside the terminal
We first need to start the container only then we can attach the terminal to it


docker images
This command will list all the images we have in our local machine. It will show us the id of the images
